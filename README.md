# Medical Imaging

This repository contains the practical sessions I developed for my Master's medical image course. The realization of this practical sessions has helped me get more comfortable working with images in jupyter notebook and I was able to learn new techniques and frameworks. 

## P1-MI-CT_Reconstruction
In medical imaging, physical phantoms refer to real objects designed to simulate the human body, or parts of it, for specific clinical conditions. Physical phantoms are used to calibrate imaging systems, to evaluate their performance and to ensure the correct operation of imaging systems before scanning human subjects. In this practical session, we had to simulate a simple phantom slice image, then apply Radom forward transformation to simulate the computed tomography (CT) projections over an slice (i.e. sinograms) and finally reconstruct the original phantom intensity values using different image reconstruction algorithms. 

## Ihona_MBDS_P2_exercises
In this practical session we had to work with some MR images of the brain and play around with biased and unbiased images. We explored T1 and T2 images as well as a kind of segmentation called "skull-stripping", a technique used to remove all parts of the MR image except of the brain. Having only the brain and not the rest of the tissues (scalp, neck, etc) make it easier for posterior analyses.

This practical session was about the analysis of functional MRI. The Haxby dataset is used for this purpose.
